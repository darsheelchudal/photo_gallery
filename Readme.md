This is a project based on Next JS, where I have implemented the ZOD to define the schema for the Image and Photo Schema , I have used the Pexels Api to fetch curated images and implemented search functionalities. I have in-depth learnt about the Image property in the NEXT Js , How we can achieve the functionalities regarding the remote i.e dynamic image contents in the Property. I have used the getPlaiceholder library to implement the Loading State in gallery view , I have implemented the Gallery such that it updates its height and width properties based on the remote response it gets. I have used envalid to validate the environment variable for better type saferty. I have also implemented the proper grid view for the breakpoints and the image is loaded dynamicallu and base on it the structure of grid is formed.
